## Task
> Write a function called *words* that takes in a string argument and counts the occurrences of each word in the string.  The function should return a JSON object showing the words identified, and their occurrences. For example for the input `olly olly in come free`, the output should be **{olly: 2, in: 1, come: 1, free: 1}**
